# Data Science Landing Page

An interactive landing page to promote Data Science. Check it out [here](https://laurpaik.github.io/ds-prototype)!

## Development
1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the server with `grunt server`.

## Dependencies
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)
- [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)

## Concept and experience
This was one feature for [Tim Hogan](https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/tim-hogan/11768)'s master plan for a
Data Science online learning platform. He wanted a simple but interactive landing
page to pull people into data science. It was my first time working with someone
who wasn't strictly in GA's Web Development Immersive, and I got a lot of perspective
on how other developers and engineers go through their project planning.
We had a design/brainstorming session last week, during which we discussed things like:
- What would one want out of an education platform?
- What made us decide to switch careers?
- What were our fears when changing careers?
- Pros/cons of other online learning platforms we've seen?
- How can we get people interested in Data Science?

This project focuses on that last question. Tim realy wanted to be able to share
his love for data science in a way that's not scary or intimidating. He wanted to
make simple commands or instructions that were easy enough to follow, and showed
more immediate results to encourage people. A lot of people get imposter syndrome
or worry that they can't do data science because it's complex, so having immediate
results on the landing page helps people get past that first bump.

We had brainstormed a few things going in. I spent a while experimenting with
[CodeMirror](codemirror.net) and Angular, but ultimately decided it was out of
scope. I found Typed.js to use for the "console", and it worked a lot better than
using [pure CSS](https://codepen.io/rusjames/pen/uAFhE) since it was clashing
with the flexbox.

In terms of working with Tim on this, we mostly communicated through Slack.
Thanks to [Cloudapp](https://www.getcloudapp.com/) I could record gifs to send
to Tim with updates on my project:

It was definitely a cool experience, and I'm hoping at some point I can get an
actual graph on there!
